## Software Setup - Python

This workshop relies on an installation of python on your device. You will need to have at least
python version 3.9 or later for the project that we will create here.

If you do not already have python installed on the device you are bringing to the workshop, you can
go to the [python.org downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the most
recent version.

### Windows

You can check the version of python you have installed by opening up a new command line / terminal
and typing `python --version`:
